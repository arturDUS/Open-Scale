 ## Plattform Scale with WiFi Interface and Web UI Support

It provides several weighing modes like 
> Normal weighing
> component weighing (Kinds of recipes can be created with 2 to n components and different amounts)
> counting parts depending on theire weight
> check weighing - define a wight range for a part and check if the current weight fits into the range

The responsive, browser based UI is simple to operate.
